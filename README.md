Thanks MrPikPik for the idea 🤍

# ESO-External-Music-Tool-Addon

this is an external tool which runs along-side an ingame addon to allow the game to have 'custom' music, it is not perfect and i may update in future, but it works 

> - contains everything required to run, just not the music, since i dont legally own any of the music i built this for,  you can add your own to the folders accordingly

# To Use:
Open the .rar file, inside will be the program,  for this program to run properly, you must also install the included ESO addon, there is a text document that tells you where to drag and drop the contents to

there is a Config.JSON - 1) this allows you to set the volume, 2) start at a random song anytime a songs folder is loaded, i.e combat, openworld, dungeon etc 3) Disable Combat music incase you hate that it changes when fights end so quickly, be at peace 😌

# BELOW ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF IT WORKING IN DIFFERENT AREAS / STATE OF COMBAT
